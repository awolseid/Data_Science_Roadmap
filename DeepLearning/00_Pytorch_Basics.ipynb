Reshaping, stacking, squeezing and unsqueezing**\n","\n","Often times you'll want to reshape or change the dimensions of your tensors without actually changing the values inside them. To do so, some popular methods are:\n","\n","> **Reshaping**: Reshaping refers to **changing the shape of a tensor** while maintaining the same number of elements. In PyTorch, the common operation to reshape a tensor is `view()`, which allows you to specify the desired shape. For example, you can reshape a tensor of shape (2, 3) to (3, 2) using `tensor.view(3, 2)`.\n","\n","> **Stacking**: Stacking involves **combining multiple tensors** along a new dimension. PyTorch provides the `torch.stack()` function, which stacks tensors along a specified dimension. For example, if you have two tensors of shape (2, 3) and (2, 3), you can stack them along the 0th dimension using `torch.stack([tensor1, tensor2], dim=0)` to get a resulting tensor of shape (2, 2, 3). There are also addtional functions to create mutliple tensors on top of each other `vstack()` or side by side `hstack()`.\n","\n","> **Squeezing**: Squeezing is the operation of **removing dimensions with size 1** from a tensor. It reduces the rank of the tensor. The `torch.squeeze()` function is used to remove dimensions of size 1. For example, if you have a tensor of shape (1, 3, 1, 5), you can remove the dimensions of size 1 using `torch.squeeze(tensor)` to get a resulting tensor of shape (3, 5).\n","\n","> **Unsqueezing**: Unsqueezing is the opposite operation of squeezing. It **adds dimensions with size 1** to a tensor. The `torch.unsqueeze()` function is used to add dimensions of size 1 at a specified position. For example, if you have a tensor of shape (3, 5), you can unsqueeze it along dimension 0 using `torch.unsqueeze(tensor, dim=0)` to get a resulting tensor of shape (1, 3, 5).\n","\n","| Method | One-line description |\n","| ----- | ----- |\n","| [`torch.reshape(input, shape)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.reshape.html#torch.reshape) | Reshapes `input` to `shape` (if compatible), can also use `torch.Tensor.reshape()`. |\n","| [`torch.Tensor.view(shape)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.view.html) | Returns a view of the original tensor in a different `shape` but shares the same data as the original tensor. |\n","| [`torch.stack(tensors, dim=0)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.1/generated/torch.stack.html) | Concatenates a sequence of `tensors` along a new dimension (`dim`), all `tensors` must be same size. |\n","| [`torch.squeeze(input)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.squeeze.html) | Squeezes `input` to remove all the dimenions with value `1`. |\n","| [`torch.unsqueeze(input, dim)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.1/generated/torch.unsqueeze.html) | Returns `input` with a dimension value of `1` added at `dim`. |\n","| [`torch.permute(input, dims)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.permute.html) | Returns a *view* of the original `input` with its dimensions permuted (rearranged) to `dims`. |\n","\n","Why do any of these?\n","\n","Because deep learning models (neural networks) are all about **manipulating tensors** in some way.

See the documentation on [`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch-tensor) and for [`torch.cuda`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/cuda.html#cuda-semantics).\n","2.

Set the random seed to `0` and do exercises 2 & 3 over again.\n","5. Speaking of random seeds, we saw how to set it with `torch.manual_seed()` but is there a GPU equivalent? (hint: you'll need to look into the documentation for `torch.cuda` for this one). If there is, set the GPU random seed to `1234`.\n","6. Create two random tensors of shape `(2, 3)` and send them both to the GPU (you'll need access to a GPU for this). Set `torch.manual_seed(1234)` when creating the tensors (this doesn't have to be the GPU random seed).\n","7. Perform a matrix multiplication on the tensors you created in 6 (again, you may have to adjust the shapes of one of the tensors).\n","8. Find the maximum and minimum values of the output of 7.\n","9. Find the maximum and minimum index values of the output of 7.\n","10. Make a random tensor with shape `(1, 1, 1, 10)` and then create a new tensor with all the `1` dimensions removed to be left with a tensor of shape `(10)`.
